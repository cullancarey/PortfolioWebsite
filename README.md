# Cullan's Portfolio Website Built in CDK

## About
This repository is an exact replica of [website](https://github.com/cullancarey/website) except the infrastructure is built using the Pythong CDK instead of Terraform. I enjoy all things IaC and wanted to get experience with a different technology. My website provides a good and challenging base to implement other IaC technologies. 


### CDK
CDK fully manages the website infrastructure, as seen in the [site_stacks](./site_stacks) directory.


### Disclosure
I did not write the HTML and supporting code for this website. I am not a website developer, so I used a template from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) and filled in the necessary details.
